An aesthetic I have always enjoyed has been the retro vibe. My style hasn't changed much since the 1990's, which was still heavily inspired by 1980's style, I don't anticipate changing much. But that isn't quite my point. Even though my eye still goes to neon, or synthwave, or retro, I am looking to reset my mind to the focus I had in the past.

My earlier days were filled with purpose, focus, and goals. Many things have influenced my life since then and my current outlook. Even though I don't think I'll get back to the same rose-colored glasses I was wearing then, I do think I can rediscover some of that same mindset. I can be less distracted, less compromised, and less jaded. I have seen, recently, how narrowing the aperture of my brain can make a big difference. I want to improve my ability to adjust that aperture for the moment at hand.

I am still going to dig neon and synth. Retro gaming will always be one of my favorite ways to pass downtime. But I can make a difference with a more concentrated mental framework.
