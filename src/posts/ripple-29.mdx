I am diving back in to leathercraft. But really, I am hoping it is a long term hobby. There are so many things you can buy a little widget or gadget for, but I want to get back to making specific items that handle specific needs. I end up doing a lot of planning before I actually jump in.

My first project is to make an item that is specific to my personal needs. I want to make a pancake style pocket holster for an EDC fixed blade. I have many knives, folders and fixed blades. Folders have a strong advantage in the EDC category, but the more I have used fixed blades, the more I love their versatility and durability.

I currently have a layout for the sheath of my fixed blade, which is a <a href="https://whiteriverknives.com/custom-m1-caper-black-canvas-micarta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">White River M1 Caper</a>, but I am still deciding if the sheath will be blade specific or more multi-purpose. I also want it to be ambidextrous and have fittings for many common tool clips. As I mentioned before, more progress is coming.
