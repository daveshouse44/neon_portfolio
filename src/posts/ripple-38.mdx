Spring seems just around the corner, and I am very excited. This year, I have a newfound desire to get my hands in the dirt, so I can grow food, be in touch with the land, and get grounded. Time to unplug and dig in.

I feel particularly inspired by the Fellowship program I am participating in, at <a href="https://climatebase.org/fellowship" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Climatebase</a>. There are a great many things to be done in so many sectors to try to combat climate change. I intend to use my skills to help in these sectors. However, what I need to do for my soul is get more in touch with the land that I call home.

Though I have been concerned and curious how I can do my part in climate work efforts, I never would have started this journey if I didn't read the book <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/braiding-sweetgrass-robin-wall-kimmerer/16712606?ean=9781571311771&next=t&aid=86677&listref=robin-wall-kimmerer&next=t" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Braiding Sweetgrass</a>. This book truly inspired me to refocus my goals and purpose in life to reconnect with the land.

Like all aspirations, things can change. Participating in this Fellowship has also showed me that I can take on more and do challenging things. When I really think about why I do the things I do, it makes it much easier to simplify and strive to learn from the dirt.
