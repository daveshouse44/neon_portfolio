When the season changes it is important for me to stay busy. Busy in a way that is productive and gives a positive feedback loop. I have tried the negative feedback loop thing, and it is not as pretty. Keeping my world small, I started to look around at what I could fix or improve in my immediate vicinity.

One of the first things I attempted in this goal was fixing a broken keyboard. It is a <a href="https://www.keychron.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Keychron</a> USB-C keyboard that I picked up a few years ago. This is not a review or critique. To be honest, I came across another keyboard previously so I haven't needed to use the one that was broken. But during a spout of organization, I figured I could either scrap the keyboard or try to repair it. A couple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDlOSg8M5pE" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">YouTube</a> videos, some solder, and some careful heat gun use and I was able to fix the broken Bluetooth toggle switch. What a good start.

The next improvement I had made was installing an outlet, or receptacle, in my office area. Due to some limited options I needed an outlet in a specific location in my office that didn't have one previously. Long story short, I ended up tapping into a junction box in a nearby area and running a circuit to maintenance room where i could cut in an outlet. Outlet installed, circuit tested, reorganized my office, mission complete.

Now I am hunkering down for winter. More improvements to be made, especially in the energy efficiency area. Try to keep busy so the madness of the cold months doesn't take over.
