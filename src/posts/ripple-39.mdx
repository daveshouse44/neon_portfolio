Jerk chicken from <a href="https://pimento.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Pimento</a> is still kickin' out delicious flavors and I could not be happier. I picked up a jerk chicken meal on my way home from work and it was as good as the first time I had it. I love that you can pick your spice levels and there is an array of sides and options. Kudos to you Pimento!

The first time I had visited Pimento, I was greeted by a friendly smile by the proprietor of the business. I dined in, and everything came out promptly and fresh. They even gave me some samples to try, beef pasties, and it was fantastic. Since then, I have tried many things including pulled pork, curried goat, braised oxtail, fried plantains, and tangy slaw.

Pimento has tried a number of locations and I wish them nothing but the best. Their Rhum Bar also has some wonderful cocktails and you can enjoy some music on certain nights as well. I will be back, and often.
