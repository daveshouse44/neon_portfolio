Since 2022, I have missed picking up a Choco Taco from a gas station or an ice cream truck. As far as mass produced frozen confections go, it was definitely my favorite. Just as the brightest stars eventually burn out, the Choco Taco was gone. It makes me sad but life goes on. I was so excited to hear that new <a href="https://sebastianjoesicecream.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Sebastian Joe's Kingfield Social</a> just opened and is serving their iteration of the recently vanished treat.

It did not disappoint. What made me so happy is that their version, assumingly made using far superior ingredients, was more delicious than ever. I have fond memories of the old silver pouches that various giant food producers passed around but I am glad to venture to my local ice cream shop making it with way more integrity. This visit was preceded by an exceptional dinner, right across the street, at <a href="https://bucheronrestaurant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Bûcheron</a> right before.

I have dined at every restaurant that inhabited this location and there have been some great ones. There must be a charming restaurant aura surrounding this place. I tried a lovely venison tartare that was served with super wide flat rye chips. It paired so nicely with the spruce tips and jammy egg yolk. The ricotta dumplings were surprisingly brightened by pepperoncini while balancing rich elements of mortadella, pistachios, and parmesan. Everything else I tried was well executed, and the service was great.

There were terrific wines to pair with the food and I tried one of my new favorite beverages. <a href="https://www.songcaidistillery.com/may-amaro-bitters" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Song Cai May Amaro</a> is the most intensely bitter, herbacous, and medicinal liquors. This is definitely not for everybody but I was entranced. What a flavorful evening!
