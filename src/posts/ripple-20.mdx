When I was growing up, we only got fried chicken from <a href="https://locations.kfc.com/mn" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">KFC</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Foods" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Rainbow Foods</a>, and rarely at that. I was always a big fan of those meals but I realize now that the world of fried chicken is so much bigger, and better! Especially in the last 10 years, Minnesota has seen a huge increase in quality and choices. It has been fascinating to watch and enjoy along the way.

As I said, the greater Twin Cities area has a much better selection now. This is certainly not a comprehensive list of all that is available, but a sample of the selections I've tried along the way. <a href="https://www.revivalrestaurants.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Revival's</a> original location opening was my first eye opening experience. <a href="https://www.mama-sheilas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Mama Sheila's</a> came shortly after. <a href="https://www.bullshornfoodanddrink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Bull's Horn</a> brings a delicious and pickle brine forward entry. <a href="https://www.startribune.com/bap-chicken-grand-avenue-john-gleason-closing-st-paul/600260922/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Bap and Chicken</a> did Korean Fried Chicken "KFC" so well, but sadly is closed now.

Even the fast casual game around here has seen huge improvement. My favorite is <a href="https://www.nashvillecoop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Nashville Coop</a>. I have also enjoyed <a href="https://locations.raisingcanes.com/mn" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Cane's</a>, <a href="https://www.popeyes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Popeye's</a> and the newcomer of <a href="https://www.daveshotchicken.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Dave's Hot Chicken</a>. I have so many on my personal list to try still. I am spreading them out so that my already slightly cholesterol doesn't explode. I won't even go into all the fried chicken sandwiches or chicken wings that the fine restaurants of the area offer. That's a whole different story.

After looking at all the wonderful choices, is Minnesota a fried chicken destination? I don't think that is really for me to say. I am extremely happy to have all the available choices, and I think fried chicken fans from anywhere could find something they like here.
