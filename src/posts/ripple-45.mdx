Things are brutal, things are sad, and things are a mess. I don't think it is fixable
with our current stategies of addressing problems. That doesn't mean I have no hope
for the future, but I fear the scope of what is salvageable will not include anything
resembling our current setup.

I am going to keep doing whatever I can to keep making things better. There are things worth fighting for and I hope that some semblance of a legacy can guide a path for future generations. Learn from our mistakes! For me, I am going to learn to swim so I can survive the sinking ship and hopefully heed warning.
