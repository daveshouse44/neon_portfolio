One of the few holiday traditions I have had for the last several years, is giving the gift of bacon. It is hardly fancy, but the people we exchange gifts with certainly like it. A big reason I like to do it is because I like to share my favorite bacon producer, <a href="https://www.nueskes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Nueske's</a>.

I usually give people the Super Bacon Sampler which showcases all their tasty bacon varieties. The flagship bacon is classic applewood smoked. They also have cherrywood, pepper bacon, and extra thick sliced. Nueske's bacon has a very pronounced smoke flavor, but not overpowering. The bacon is always has nice marbling and I like to use the different variety for various cooking purposes.

The flagship applewood is the best all purpose bacon, delicious on its own and works in any recipe. The cherrywood has a slightly more subtle flavor and I think it is best as a side to a tasty breakfast. I like the cherrywood unadulterated, unless it happens to get a splash of maple syrup on it. The pepper bacon is amazing on a BLT, in a breakfast burrito, or used in a carbonara pasta.

We don't do a ton of gifting but I like to share this tasty treat with the people we care about. It is fun to hear people's excitement when they receive it and share our various culinary uses with it.
