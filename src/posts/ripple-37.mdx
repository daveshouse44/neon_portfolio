Finding things to be excited about in 2025 has been a bit challenging. However, I am looking forward to a new experience that is coming up soon. I have joined the <a href="https://climatebase.org/fellowship" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Climatebase Fellowship</a> Cohort 7! Though I was a bit apprehensive taking on another larger time commitment along with my volunteer web development for <a href="https://www.earthhero.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Earth Hero</a>, I decided to go ahead and dive in.

It was through my connections at Earth Hero that I discovered the Climatebase platform, primarily for their job board, and then had seen sign up opportunities for the Fellowship. I have long had a strong sense of leaving any place better than I had found it. My interest in finding work or activities focused on that, along with my new found programming skills, gives me hope that I can make things better.

The Fellowship focuses on several items that I believe I can make great use out of in the next phase of my development:

- Finding a job in climate (transitioning from another industry or accelerating an existing climate career)
- Deepening climate literacy
- Working on a Capstone project to explore a passion or idea and/or build up expertise
- Founding a startup (a bit on the nose considering a current work project)
- Expanding their climate community and professional network

Though I am not especially interested in founding a startup, and likely not having the capacity to work on a Capstone project, all the other goals are exactly what I am looking for. The Fellowship will be a large undertaking and hopefully worthwhile new adventure. I am also hoping it expands my comfort zone and keep me with a beacon to swim towards in the sea of otherwise uncertainty.
