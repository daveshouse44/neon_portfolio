Dullness is a thing I have noticed has been taking over in my life. Specifically, I am talking about knives. It could certainly be extrapolated to other meanings, and rightfully so. But I am going to keep the topic to blades for now.

I have a mulititude of ways to sharpen blades, most frequently knives. I have series of whetstones, but to be honest, I have not dedicated the time needed to properly master this process. I have two products from <a href="https://worksharptools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Work Sharp</a> that I really like. I have a <a href="https://worksharptools.com/products/rolling-knife-sharpener" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">RKS Rolling Knife Sharpener</a>, which to be honest, is incredibly easy to use and gets the blade to a very nice edge. It might not be the sharpest possible, but for the skill and effort involved, I don't think it can be beat. I also have a <a href="https://worksharptools.com/products/ken-onion-edition-knife-tool-sharpener-mk-2%E2%84%A2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Ken Onion Edition Knife and Tool Sharpener</a>, which is a little more challenging to use, but can deliver a nice edge on many different types of blades.

Any of the tools I have chosen can get you to where you need to go. If you have crazy speciific needs, the rolling knife sharpener might not be the best choice. It is also limited for the widest range of blades that you might need honed. My biggest sharpening needs are kitchen and pocket knives, so the rolling blade sharpener is the most efficient choice for me. Regardless, It has been very nice to work on something extremely tangible and measurable. There is so much madness going on in the world, and it is so helpful to use my hands to create a purposeful and controllable outcome.
