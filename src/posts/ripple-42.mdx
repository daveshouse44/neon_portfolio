Though I am very excited to be starting a new chapter in my career, I also wish that I could have wrapped up my previous chapter in a more satisfying way. Don't get me wrong, I worked hard, I gave it my best shot, but towards the end I felt like I had given up on making meaningful improvements to the work environment.

I wanted to make things better, but there was no structure or support to do so. There was no plan to do things systematically, just constantly looking years down the road while we were currently floundering.

I don't mean to talk ill of the past experience, everyone meant well, I learned a lot, and worked with incredible people. And as the writing was beginning to appear on the wall, a new opportunity presented itself. And I jumped at it. I wish I could have put a more definitive stamp on my time there, however, there is no sense dwelling on the past, life goes on.
