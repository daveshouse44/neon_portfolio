My house is full of artwork. Prints, paintings, graphics, and DIY items. One of the themes throughout this artwork is lots of color. I find it interesting that my clothes are typically pretty plain, simply colored, lacking graphics, and with low contrast. But I don't look at myself, or my clothes all that often, but I do enjoy decorations in my house.

I have several pieces of artwork on my wall that are either print or painted canvas. But they do not have a frame. I have had prints or original pieces on paper framed. Trying to frame a piece of stretched canvas can be incredibly expensive though. I figured there was an easier way.

With no power tools, and a couple of YouTube videos, I learned some techniques to build simple wooden frames for these stretched canvas pieces of art. It is a simple enhancement but the art looks much more elevated. I used a simple saw, mitre box, wood glue, brad nails, stain, and polyurethane. Most of which I already had. I ended up framing 3 pieces for under 100 dollars all told.

These were simple projects that made a small difference in my home. I enjoyed, and needed, some simple task to make incremental improvements when I had nothing better to do. It also felt like I was taking care of myself, which is always helpful.
