import { Image } from "astro:assets";
import thisIs from "../assets/images/this.jpg";

<Image src={thisIs} alt="This is it neon sign" height="600" width="1200" />

At this point I am feeling very confident with <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">React</a>, <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Astro</a>, and <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Next</a> for developing my projects. <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Tailwind</a> is my preferred CSS option for styling. I feel comfortable with the various integrations and I have even tried using both with as headless CRM. I am hearing alot about other options now like <a href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Svelte</a>, <a href="https://go.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Go</a>, <a href="https://htmx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">HTMX</a>, <a href="https://alpinejs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Alpine</a>, and others. Is it worth my time exploring these other options?

What it comes down to is the purpose of the project. I think it would be more than worth my while to do some small experiments with these other frameworks to see how the syntax compares to what I am familar with. However, when it comes to shipping projects, I will continue to stick with what I know. I even feel pretty comfortable with building with basic HTML, JavaScript, with a splash of <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">jQuery</a>. So much of the web is built with these "older" technologies and I think it is important to have a strong understanding with them.

I do want to continue to grow my skills and improve. At this point I think it is still much more beneficial to continue to build with what I know. If a project comes up that demands a different framework due to the requirements, I will be eager to learn and adapt. Until then, I will continue to build with what I know.
