A little over a year ago, I was experiencing some issues that caused me to seek out physical therapy. After a number of sessions, it became clear that I was basically being prescribed yoga. In the ever-interesting world of American healthcare, it made way more fiscal sense to join the local yoga studio instead continuing of PT.

Sheepishly, this is my entry into yoga practice despite my mother being a yogi. Sorry mom! A big shout out to the <a href="https://www.yogasix.com/location/nokomis" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">YogaSix Nokomis</a> studio for making me feel like a part of their community. The trend and variations of yoga in the Western hemisphere is very fascinating, but not the scope of this writing.

My experience has been that yoga is so much more than a form of exercise or simply doing something good for my health. It resonates with me that it is referred to as a practice, and feels very much like another craft to me. That craft is creating a mind and body connection. Sometimes its fun and invigorating. Sometimes it kicks my ass and is hard to get in the right headspace.

Yoga has greatly improved my well-being, and I'm thankful for the support from my loved ones. I'm excited to continue to practice my craft, especially since the end product is a better me.
