My reading habit is something that I tend to fall in and out of. I very much enjoy reading, but I can get caught into cycles where I am not picking up books nearly as often as other times. It is kind of hard to say why. I really enjoy reading, but I don't force myself to do it. However, I was actually watching some book reviews on YouTube and I was nudged to check out one of the recommended books.

I have plenty of books in my library that are on my list to read. But those were books I decided I wanted to read years, or sometimes decades ago. Based on one particular review, and confirmed by several others, I went to go pick up a copy of <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/everything-is-tuberculosis-signed-edition-the-history-and-persistence-of-our-deadliest-infection-john-green/21901967" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Everything is Tuberculosis</a> by John Green at my local bookstore, <a href="https://www.moonpalacebooks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Moon Palace Books</a>. I try to buy any book from a local bookstore, whether it is for myself or as a gift. I will also purchase from <a href="https://bookshop.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Bookshop.org</a> if a book is not available. While I was there, I also picked up a gift for my mom for Mother's Day, <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/between-two-kingdoms-a-memoir-of-a-life-interrupted-suleika-jaouad/11375409" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Between Two Kingdoms</a> by Suleika Jaouad. I also picked up <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-ninth-metal-benjamin-percy/14804736?ean=9781328544865&next=t" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">The Ninth Metal</a> by Benjamin Percy, for myself. I have always enjoyed a good sci-fi book.

I blasted through _Everything is Tuberculosis_ in a few days. Informative, funny, terribly sad, and very humanizing. That put me on a tear to read several more books in a short period of time. I read The _Ninth Metal_ in a few days as well, a fun book after the very heavy subject matter of the previous book. I am now almost done with <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/hip-hop-is-history-questlove/20502131?ean=9780374614072&next=t" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Hip Hop is History</a> by Questlove. That was a book I had picked up from another great local bookstore, <a href="https://www.commabookshop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Comma Bookshop</a>. I got that book a while ago after seeing Questlove's documentary <a href="https://www.searchlightpictures.com/summerofsoul/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Summer of Soul</a>. His writing is unbelievable dense, personal, and informative. Questlove has an ability to pack deeply complex ideas about music and culture into a single sentence.

I am eager to finish _Hip Hop is History_ so I can start on <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-serviceberry-robin-wall-kimmerer/21259025?ean=9781668072240&next=t" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">The Serviceberry</a> by Robin Wall Kimmerer. It has also been in my library since reading her book <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/braiding-sweetgrass-robin-wall-kimmerer/16712606?ean=9781571313560&next=t" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Braiding Sweetgrass</a> some time ago. I hope this particular book habit gets me into a more regular routine of reading. More books to read, less doom to scroll.
