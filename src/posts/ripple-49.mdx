My hopes to dive in to leathercrafting were not as successful as I had hoped. I had tried a couple of small new projects, but nothing along the lines of a consistent practice of skills. It seems very common to want to go all in on a new, or revisted, hobby. But sometimes it is just hard to get going, even if it is something you really want to do.

I am trying a new approach this time around. When a need, or particular project seems obvious, I will go after it. Otherwise, I am trying to keep practicing basic skills when I have time. Cutting, burnishing edges, dyeing, and testing patterns of embossing. I don't have to be working specifically on a project, but I do want to keep working on the basic skills.

I feel like at some point there is going ot be a tipping point where I can start to build momentum again. I just need to keep at it, even if it is just a little bit at a time.
