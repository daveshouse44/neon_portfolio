People in this country, and especially in Minnesota right now, are fed up. No Kings, Ice Out, Tax Billionaires, and many more frequent chants are what you hear in the street. Absolutely nothing is perfect, that is for sure, but an overreaching, and vindictive federal government is the line.

I understand political differences and folks having opposing opinions, that's fine. The situation we find ourselves in right now is that we can't even find a baseline for an objective reality. Even if it is documented, measured, recorded, or easily sensed. The general public tears itself to pieces to where civil debate is no longer possible, a distraction, all the while money is funneled up to the greed class like a vacuum. Wealth is about momentum and we don't have it.

Will we tear ourselves apart while a small group of technofascists steers us towards the singularity, as they call it? Can we realize that we still have agency, we still have the numbers, and the power? It probably won't be one extreme or the other, but I feel like it is going to get messy.

And what is it all for? What is the point of accumulation? Exploration and advancement doesn't seem like the goal. We all turn to dust no matter what. We are so out of sync with the planet and nature that there likely is no going back. If we wipe ourselves out in 100 years, or a million, does it even matter? A blip on the radar for our little blue ball we call home. Maybe it will remember us well, but more likely to say good riddence with our current path.
