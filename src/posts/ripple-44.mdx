Starting this new role feels different from anything I’ve done before. In the past, my work had me deep in the details of coding, building, and troubleshooting. There was satisfaction in seeing things run, but at times I felt like I was so focused on the weeds that I couldn’t step back and look at the whole system. Now, I find myself in a position where the focus is less on implementation and more on making sense of the bigger picture, figuring out what needs to happen before we even pick up tools. It’s a shift that excites me, even though it’s a little intimidating to step away from what I’ve known.

What I appreciate about this change is the chance to think more holistically. Instead of measuring success by lines of code written or bugs fixed, it’s about shaping direction, setting priorities, and aligning others toward a shared vision. That doesn’t mean it’s easier—it comes with its own set of challenges. The decisions I’m making now don’t have immediate proof points or tangible outputs the way code once did. But strategy has ripple effects. A well-thought-out plan today can save months of confusion down the road, and I find that responsibility meaningful in a new way.

Of course, part of me misses the problem-solving rush of digging through logic and debugging an issue, but I see this transition as growth. The skills I built as a developer—patience, curiosity, persistence—are not lost; they’ve just shifted into a new context. And while I don’t know exactly where this path leads, I’m grateful to be in a role where I can help shape not just products, but also the way people work together to create them. It’s a different kind of building—one less visible, maybe, but no less important.
