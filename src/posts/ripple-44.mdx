Starting this new role feels different from anything I've done before. In the past, many aspects of my work had me focused on the details of coding, building, and troubleshooting. I enjoyed that very granular type of work, but at times I felt like I could be so focused on the details that I had to remind myself to step back and look at the big picture. Now, I find myself in a position where the focus is less on implementation and more on high level strategy, figuring out what needs to happen before we even pick up tools. It's a shift that feels like an exciting new challenge.

What I appreciate about this change is the chance to think more holistically. Instead of measuring success by lines of code written or bugs fixed, it's about shaping direction, setting priorities, and aligning others toward a shared vision. That doesn't mean it's easier, it just comes with its own set of challenges. The decisions I'm making now don't always have immediate visual feedback the way coding does. But strategy has ripple effects. A well-thought-out plan today can save months of confusion down the road, and I find that responsibility meaningful in a new way.

Of course, part of me misses the problem-solving rush of digging through logic and debugging an issue, but I see this transition as growth. The skills I built as a developer like patience, curiosity, and persistence are not lost. They have just shifted into a new context. And while I don't know exactly where this path leads, I'm grateful to be in a role where I can help shape not just our digital presence, but also the way people work understand what our oganization does. It's a different kind of building, one less visible, maybe, but no less important.
