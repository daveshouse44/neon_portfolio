Leathercraft is a new hobby that I have been exploring, and 100% was a COVID pandemic aspirational activity that turned in to a functional skill. It fits in well with my other interests and how I like to create things that I need.

That being said, I don't have nearly enough practice or experience to call myself an expert. This is more of a craft that I can fill my time and keep my mind sharp with, while keeping my hands busy. It is a lot of fun and I am able to make some simple but helpful items.

This is still very much in the experimental and learning phase, but I have been able to make some simple projects that I am happy with. Knife sheaths, tool holders, clothing fixes, and other small accessories is where I have gotten started so far.

Someday I might entertain the idea of sharing my crafts, but I would want to hone my skill quite a bit more before I would feel comfortable doing that. I am still very much a beginner, but I am having a lot of fun with it.
