Vehicle repair has never been an interest or particular talent of mine. Other than some basic electrical work, or simple aftermarket installations, I tend to rely on the experts for any repairs to my vehicles. When my Honda Ruckus didn't fire up after it's winter nap, I decided I should probably be able to figure out how to get it going again.

I did some research and found that the carburetor was likely the issue. This is an instance where I would love to have asked a friend or family member with more experience. No one in my immediate circle has that kind of expertise. I had never cleaned out a carburetor before, but I figured it was worth a shot before I took it to the mechanic. I watched a few YouTube videos and read some articles, and I felt like I had a good idea of what I needed to do.

Off with all my knowledge from strangers on the internet, I took the carburetor off the scooter and cleaned it out with some carb cleaner. It wasn't very dirty overall, but the carb jets were gummed up. After I put it back together, the scooter fired right up and ran great. I was pretty proud of myself for figuring it out, and I saved myself a trip to the mechanic.

I am not sure if I will be able to tackle any other repairs on my vehicles, but I am glad that I was able to figure this one out. It was a good feeling to be able to fix something myself, and I learned a lot in the process. I always weigh the pros and cons of doing repairs myself. Though this likely would not have been a huge cost, the added time of hooking up my scooter to a trailer and hauling it in added to my desire to get it done myself.
