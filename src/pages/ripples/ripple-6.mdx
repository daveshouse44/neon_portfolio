This will hopefully be a bit shorter. Life is always full of ups and downs, strikes and gutters, celebrations and hardships. You know all the clich√©s. What I find fascinating is how things run hot or cold for stretches.

I enjoy the holiday season and am fortunate that the stress that comes along with it is mostly positive. Coming in to the holidays though, it feels like things have been a struggl. Like I was waiting for something really positive to happen to turn the tide.

During the best place to process thought for me, a walk with my wife and dogs, that positive thing happened. What was wild was that it was completely internal. I was thinking about my life and where I am, and I was overwhelmed with feeling incredibly lucky.

It's a crazy, terrible, fascinating world. I am thankful I get to take the ride and experience all of it.
