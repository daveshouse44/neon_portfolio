We have two dogs. Their name's are Hank and Pepper and they are pretty good. Hank is an 8 year old Pomeranian/Alaskan Cattle Dog and Pepper is a 1 year old Beagle/Boxer. They are both rescues, about 25 pounds, kind of a handful, and we love them very much.

Hank is a little bit of a grumpy boy. We got him about 5 years ago tomorrow and he has come a long way. Hank came from an hoarding situation and is still pretty timid. He is very loyal, protective, and loves to lounge on the couch or the bed. He has always been a little difficult because he is not very food motivated.

Pepper is kind of nuts. We adopted her just over a year ago. When we first got her she wanted to climb on everything, would only sleep in our laps, was terribly sick, and whined constantly. She has also come a long way, even though she is still trouble. She loves to play, chew, eat, and give Hank a hard time. She tasks us but she also makes us laugh.

I can't imagine not having dogs around. I feel like having dogs has made me a much better person. The first dog we had was also a rescue. We didn't know much about her background. She had a lot of scars and was missing a leg. She almost never barked and was the sweetest, snuggliest dog. She was also very disgusting but she melted our hearts. After meeting Applejack, we knew we would be dog people forever.

We could probably do more to encourage the "right" dog behavior, but as long as the aren't destroying things we are happy to let them be themselves. They are goofy, weird, and unique. Looking at the anthropology of how dogs and humans have evolved together is fascinating, and I think humanity is better off with our best friends.
