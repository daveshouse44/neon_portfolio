My wife and I are extremely fortunate that one of our biggest challenges, is what we are going to eat for dinner. The main reason is that we really enjoy cooking at home, but if we haven't planned a meal, we don't necessarily have everything we need to craft a dinner at home. We have both worked in the restaurant and service industry so executing a tasty dinner at home is usually fun and easy.

After a lovely suggestion by my wife of a dinner cooked at home, with ingredients that we had in the house. I said, "No thank you, let's go get sushi". We love checking out the local restaurants in town, but typically avoid going out on a Friday night. We ran over to happy hour at <a href="https://www.kyatchi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Kyatchi</a> and it was terrific. Churro donuts at <a href="https://www.boludo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="whitespace-nowrap underline decoration-neon transition hover:text-neon">Boludo</a> was also a last minute, but brilliant decision.

There are several places in town that have sushi happy hours. Many of those restaurants focus more on drink sales and perhaps are a bit less focused on the sushi. You tend to find pretty basic rolls and fried appetizers. Kyatchi's happy hour offers a modest discount, but delivers the high quality and unique items we prefer. Their focus on quality is evident, sourcing only sustainable fish and seafood. I am far from a sushi expert, but every time we have gone to Kyatchi, I try something I have never had before.

After many rounds of small plates, wine and sake, we left happy and full. Just around the corner is Boludo, an Argentinian pizzaria. We were too full for their delicious pizza or empenadas, but had room for Churro donuts and Modelos! They are so flavorful, packed with cinnamon, just a touch of sweetness, salty, and the perfect combination of textures. I could live in the dulce de leche served along side.
